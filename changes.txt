Fixes:
    + Filter "$lt" & "$gt" did not work correctly (If the document was 1 and the query included 1 - the document was dumped)
    + Filter "$or" could put the server down if the data for the sub-filter was specified incorrectly

Changes:
    + The "$text" filter was removed (replaced by $regex)

Additions:
    + New "$regex" filter
    + New filter "$and"
