Additions:
    + Evenly returns data when u have a huge amount of documents ("distribute" setting in config)

Changes:
    + Increased filter handling performance

Fixes:
    + Corrected some comments in the config for better understanding
    + instantUpdate now doesnâ€™t overwrite the _id of found documents based on filters (the _id from the first document overwrote the _id of all other documents, because of which during subsequent manipulations with the documents, the database wasn't working properly)
